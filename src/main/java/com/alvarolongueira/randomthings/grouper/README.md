# randomthings -> grouper

I had to manage many similar objects to obtain some common values and data.
I created a object LineGrouperWithPriority, that has all the logic: adding elements, sorting and obtaining their common fields.
I created LineGrouperKey, that represents the fields that has to be used.
Using inheritance, there are two examples: OrderLineGrouper and DistributionLineGrouper.
The rest of the classes are part of the keys and fields to calculate things.

There is a test to see this OrderLineGrouperTest
